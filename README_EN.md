---

GoMentor is a local-first, cross-platform desktop workbench for Go students and teachers. It is not just a chat panel beside a board: it turns KataGo, board screenshots, local knowledge cards, long-term student memory, and a multimodal LLM into an agentic Go teacher.

Ask it to:

- explain the current move,
- review the full game,
- diagnose a player's latest 10 games,
- create a one-week training plan from recurring weaknesses.

KataGo is the source of truth. The LLM is the teacher that turns those facts into clear, actionable coaching.

## Highlights

### Professional Go workbench

- Left rail: players, Fox public games, SGF import, and game library.
- Center: KTrain/Lizzie-inspired board, coordinates, stones, candidates, played-move comparison, PV preview, and winrate timeline.
- Right rail: AI-editor-style teacher composer, streamed replies, tool logs, and structured review cards.

### Lizzie-inspired live analysis

- Loading a game starts KataGo analysis automatically.
- Selecting a move on the winrate timeline continues analysis for that position.
- Analysis remains stopped only after the user explicitly clicks pause.
- Candidate points show rank, winrate, score lead, and visits.
- Played moves are compared against KataGo candidates, and problem moves are judged by winrate/score loss.

### Agentic teacher runtime

The teacher can call tools instead of following fixed templates:

- `library.findGames`
- `sgf.readGameRecord`
- `katago.analyzePosition`
- `katago.analyzeGameBatch`
- `board.captureTeachingImage`
- `knowledge.searchLocal`
- `studentProfile.read/write`
- `report.saveAnalysis`

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Python 3.10+
- KataGo binary and model
- Optional OpenAI-compatible multimodal LLM API

```bash
pnpm install
python3 -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
pnpm dev
```

Checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm check
```

Packaging:

```bash
pnpm dist:mac
pnpm dist:win
pnpm dist:linux
```

## Privacy

- Games, reports, settings, and student profiles stay under `~/.gomentor` by default.
- Saved LLM API keys are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` when available.
- Current-move teaching may send a board screenshot, KataGo JSON, and selected knowledge cards to the configured LLM endpoint.
- Web search is optional and should only use generic Go concepts.
